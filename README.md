# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, two players compete against each other, marking cells on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks (either "X" or "O") in a row, column, or diagonal wins. The game ends in a draw when the grid is filled without a winner.
